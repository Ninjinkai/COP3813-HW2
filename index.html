        <h1>What is Octonauts?</h1>
        <p>The Octonauts are an anthropomorphic team of underwater explorers.  Originally a series of illustrated books, the Octonauts are now popularied in a computer-animated children's TV show.</p>
        <h1>Why should kids watch the Octonauts?</h1>
        <p>The show, and it's associated properties, encourage interest in science, technology, and environmentalism.  Using their high-tech deep sea vehicles, the team encounters real marine animals and works to solve problems, both natural and man-made.</p>
        <h1>The Octonauts and Me</h1>
        <p>My son is four years old, and he is crazy about the Octonauts.  If we turn on the TV, he demands to watch Octonauts.  If I give him an iPad, he looks for anything Octonauts on YouTube.  If he uses a computer, he wants to play games on the Octonauts website.  We have at least 5 Octonauts books, and read at least one almost every night.  I'm very happy that he chose such a positive and educational show to obsess over, but I wish he could get his emotions under control when we tell him time is up.  Anytime we have to take the Octonauts away, it's a tantrum.</p>
